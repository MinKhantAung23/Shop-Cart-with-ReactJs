        Welcome to Basic Cart Management Shop! I specialize in creating shopping
        experiences using technologies like React, Redux Toolkit, and RTK
        Query.My goal is to provide a simple solution for managing carts in
        online store. I have chosen to use the FakeStoreAPI for simulating an
        online store environment. At this Basic Cart Management Shop, you can
        see nothing special just basic cart management about online shop.
