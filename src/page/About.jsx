        About Min Khant Aung's Cart Management Shop
      </h1>
      <p className="tracking-wide leading-8 text-gray-500">
        Welcome to Min Khant Aung's Cart Management Shop! I specialize in
        creating shopping experiences using technologies like React, Redux
        Toolkit, and RTK Query.My goal is to provide a simple solution for
        managing carts in online store. I have chosen to use the FakeStoreAPI
        for simulating an online store environment.There is still a lot of error
        like error handling. At Min Khant Aung's Cart Management Shop, you can
        see basic cart management about online shop.
